# Luis's SVG Logo Maker (Module 10 Object-oriented Programming Challenge) 


## This Challenge contains Luis's SVG Logo Maker Generator to include the following functions:
- Allows users to generate a SVG Logo Maker for themselves
- The following questions will be asked:
 1. What text should go inside of SVG (at most 3 characters)?
 2. What color should the text be (must be a valid color or hexadecimal)?
 3. What shape would you like your logo to be?
 4. What color should the SVG shape be (must be a valid color or hexadecimal)?

- Once the information is entered a .svg file will be generated in the file.


## Installation
- To Access the SVG Logo Maker Generator repository: https://github.com/ricanlonghorn23/Luis-SVG-Logo-Maker.git

## Usage
The user will go to the file in which the SVG Logo Maker code is located. They will type in “npm i inquirer@8.2.4” to install the inquirer package. The user will then type in "npm i -D jest" and then  "npm install --save-dev jest" to install jest package. The user will then run "npx jest" to run test on files. Once the test has passed, the user with run “node index.js” and the SVG Logo Maker Generator will begin asking the questions. Once the fields are completed a .svg file will be automatically generated.
